# Challenge 1, Horiseon Homepage

## Description
This is my first challenge for my bootcamp. I was tasked with refactoring this code to make it more accessible. To do this I added altertnative attributes to each image used on the webpage. To make the webpage easier to access online I also changed the title to one that would summarize the webpage. Then finally, I fixed the search engine optimization header in the top right of the page so that when you click it, it will link you to that topic on the webpage.

## Usage
Learning to refactor code and pick up where someone else left off is a big part of becoming a full stack developer. Now since this is just a challenge, the skill learned was to refactor code and with practice I will only get better.
